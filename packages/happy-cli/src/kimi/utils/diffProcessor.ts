/**
 * Diff Processor for Kimi - Handles file edit events and tracks unified_diff changes
 * 
 * This processor tracks changes from fs-edit events and tool_call results that contain
 * file modification information, converting them to KimiDiff tool calls similar to Gemini/Codex.
 * 
 * Note: Kimi ACP doesn't have direct turn_diff events like Codex, so we track
 * file changes through fs-edit events and tool results that may contain diff information.
