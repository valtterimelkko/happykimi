### User Initial Intent

the happy cli uses claude code cli and codex cli well by default. However, WITHOUT any edits or execution, I want you to deep-analyse the following question:


Could happy / happy cli be made to work with kimi code / kimi code cli as well? And what kind of a project would it be to be able to do that? We of course need to remember there's the happy mobile app and the happy cli - which might mean, they both need to support kimi code cli to a degree?


### Full analysis of the change by Kimi Code

Deep Analysis Complete: Happy + Kimi Code CLI Integration
I've created a comprehensive analysis document at /tmp/kimi-happy-integration-analysis.md. Here are the key findings:

✅ Yes, Happy CAN work with Kimi Code CLI
Happy's architecture already supports multiple AI providers (Claude, Codex, Gemini). Adding Kimi follows established patterns.

🏗️ Current Architecture
Happy uses a modular provider pattern:

happy-cli/src/
├── claude/          # Claude Code
├── codex/           # Codex CLI  
├── gemini/          # Gemini
└── index.ts         # Routes: happy → claude, happy codex → codex
The mobile app already has agent switching:

// happy-app uses agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini'
🔑 Why Integration is Feasible
Requirement	Kimi Support	Status
MCP (Model Context Protocol)	kimi --mcp-config	✅ Native
JSON streaming	kimi --output-format stream-json	✅ Compatible
Session management	kimi --session ID	✅ Supported
Non-interactive mode	kimi --print	✅ Available
ACP Protocol	kimi acp	✅ Advanced option
📋 Implementation Scope
Estimated: 3-4 weeks (for experienced contributor)

Phase 1: Happy CLI (1-2 weeks)

Create src/kimi/runKimi.ts (follow Codex pattern)
Add happy kimi subcommand
MCP server integration
Session management
Phase 2: Mobile App (1 week)

Add 'kimi' to agent types
CLI availability detection
Settings panel
Phase 3: Polish (1 week)

Permission modes
Error handling
Testing
⚠️ Key Challenges
Session Persistence - Kimi uses --session ID flag (different from Claude's hooks)
Output Format - Kimi's JSON stream is similar to Codex ✓
Permission Handling - Kimi has --yolo, needs granular control
CLI Distribution - Kimi is binary + VS Code extension (vs npm packages)
🎯 Recommended Approach
Hybrid Strategy:

Phase 1: Direct process spawn (like Codex) - Quick win
Phase 2: ACP protocol integration - Better long-term
Kimi's native kimi acp (Agent Communication Protocol) is designed for exactly this use case!

🔗 About the Clawdbot Branch
The clawdbot-integration branch appears to be early work-in-progress - no actual Clawdbot implementation was found in the codebase. It has a different folder structure but no new agent integration yet.

💡 Bottom Line
This is a medium-complexity feature addition, not a fundamental architecture change. Happy's multi-provider design makes Kimi integration a natural extension.

PHASE 1: Happy CLI (Week 1-2) — "Make it work in terminal"
What You Do
Type happy kimi in your terminal and Kimi starts with Happy integration.

What Gets Built
// NEW FILE: packages/happy-cli/src/kimi/runKimi.ts

export async function runKimi(opts) {
    // 1. Start Happy's MCP server (for mobile communication)
    const happyServer = await startHappyServer({...});
    
    // 2. Create config file for Kimi
    const mcpConfig = { mcpServers: { happy: { url: "http://localhost:PORT" } } };
    
    // 3. SPAWN KIMI (the actual CLI)
    const kimiProcess = spawn('kimi', [
        '--mcp-config', mcpConfigPath,     // Connect to Happy
        '--output-format', 'stream-json',  // JSON output
        '--session', sessionId             // Track session
    ]);
    
    // 4. Bridge messages between Kimi ↔ Mobile
    kimiProcess.stdout.on('data', (msg) => api.sendToMobile(msg));
    api.onMobileMessage((msg) => kimiProcess.stdin.write(msg));

💡 Simple Analogy
Phase 1	Phase 2
Car analogy	Build the engine	Build the dashboard
Restaurant	Kitchen makes food	Waiter takes order
Music	Speaker plays sound	Phone app controls volume
Phase 1 = The "backend" that runs Kimi
Phase 2 = The "frontend" that lets you control it

Both needed for complete experience! 🎉


### User asks

Phase 1 - after Phase 1 has completed, would the user then in the mobile app click on 'Codex' - for example - and then, instead of Codex, they'd get Kimi Code?


### Kimi Code explains

No, that's not quite right. After Phase 1 alone, the flow would be different (and slightly broken). Let me clarify:

What Actually Happens After Phase 1 ONLY
The Problem
Phase 1 makes happy kimi work in the terminal, but the mobile app doesn't know "Kimi" exists yet. So:

Terminal: $ happy kimi
          ↓
Terminal: [QR Code displayed]
          ↓
Mobile:   User scans QR code
          ↓
Mobile:   "Unknown agent type" or shows generic session
          ↓
Works!    But no Kimi branding/options
The user would NOT click "Codex" - that would start an actual Codex session, not Kimi.

How It Actually Works
After Phase 1 (CLI only):
User types happy kimi in terminal
QR code appears
User scans with mobile app
Session works BUT:
Mobile app shows generic/"unknown" agent
No Kimi-specific settings
Can't create Kimi sessions from mobile
Session list might show wrong icon
After Phase 2 (App integration):
Mobile:   User taps "New Session"
          ↓
Mobile:   [Claude] [Codex] [Gemini] [Kimi] ← NEW BUTTON
          ↓
Mobile:   User taps [Kimi]
          ↓
Mobile:   QR Code displayed
          ↓
Terminal: Kimi starts automatically (or was already running)
          ↓
Mobile:   Full Kimi session with proper branding!
The Correct Flow Options
Phase	How User Starts Kimi	What Mobile Shows
Phase 1 only	Terminal: happy kimi	Generic/unknown session
Phase 2 only	Mobile: Tap "Kimi" button	Error (no CLI support)
Both phases	Either terminal OR mobile	Full Kimi experience
Bottom Line
You need BOTH phases for a proper experience:

Phase 1 = Backend capability (Kimi can run with Happy)
Phase 2 = Frontend recognition (Mobile knows what Kimi is)
Without Phase 2, the mobile app would be confused about what kind of session it's controlling. It might work technically, but the UX would be broken (wrong icons, missing settings, etc.).

### User asks

I use the android app. So for the Phase 2: I've heard that the easiest workflow is using React Native with Expo, which creates a scaffolded project structure that Claude Code / Kimi Code or similar agents can then edit. Would that help with the Phase 2? I'm not sure at this stage whether I'd be looking into publishing the outcome of the Phase 2 at all, or whether I'd just be using it myself. What do you think?

### Kimi Code explains

Great news - you already have the Expo project!

The Happy app is already built with React Native + Expo. You don't need to create a new scaffolded project. Here's what you actually have:

What You Already Have
/root/happykimi/packages/happy-app/
├── package.json          # Already Expo-based ✅
├── app.config.js         # Expo config ✅
├── index.ts              # Entry point ✅
├── sources/
│   ├── app/              # React Native screens
│   ├── components/       # UI components
│   └── ...               # All the app code
├── android/              # Android native files
└── ios/                  # iOS native files
It's already a complete Expo project! Phase 2 is about modifying the existing code, not creating a new app.

What Phase 2 Actually Means for You
The Changes Are Small
You're only adding Kimi as a 4th agent option alongside Claude, Codex, and Gemini:

// Before (3 options):
const agents = ['claude', 'codex', 'gemini'];

// After (4 options):
const agents = ['claude', 'codex', 'gemini', 'kimi'];
The actual code changes are ~50-100 lines across 3-4 files.

Your Options for Using It
Option A: Build APK for Personal Use (Recommended)
Since you own the fork and just want to use it yourself:

cd /root/happykimi/packages/happy-app

# Build Android APK (no Play Store needed)
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Or run directly on connected Android device
yarn android
Pros:

✅ No publishing required
✅ Use your custom version alongside official app
✅ Quick iteration
Option B: Use Development Build
# Install expo-dev-client
npx expo install expo-dev-client

# Run development server
yarn start

# Connect with Expo Go app (limited) or dev client
Pros:

✅ Fastest for development
✅ Hot reload
Cons: Needs dev client installed
Option C: Publish to Play Store (Future)
Only if you want others to use it:

Requires new app ID
Google Play developer account ($25)
Separate from official Happy app
My Recommendation
For your use case (personal + Android):

Complete Phase 1 first (get happy kimi working in terminal)
Make minimal Phase 2 changes (add Kimi to agent list)
Build APK with EAS: eas build --platform android
Install APK on your phone and use it!
You don't need to publish anything. The APK works independently.

Expo Does Help, But...
You're right that Expo makes editing easier, but the Happy app already IS an Expo project. You just need to:

Edit the existing TypeScript files
Run yarn android to test
Build APK when ready
No scaffolding needed - it's already done! 🎉
